# Zaius Base Schema & Modules
When building Zaius apps, mapping to the base
Zaius schema and/or using Schema Modules ensures that your app /
integration is consistent with other apps of the same category. 

By being consistent with schema, users of your app will be able to
leverage 1-click campaign recipes, standard reporting, and avoid complex
troubleshooting.
